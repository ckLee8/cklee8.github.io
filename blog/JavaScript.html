	<h2>Ruby vs. Javascript: LOOPING</h2>
	<p>Although loops in javascript and ruby both function in similar ways and have the same underlying principles, the implementation and execution in the two languages are worlds apart. Syntactically, these languages vary quite heavily. For one, loops are a lot less cumbersome in ruby than in javascript. The reason for this is the need for curly braces and semi colons in javascript. Another thing that might make javascript more difficult for beginners is the flow of logic in the loop statement. For instance, in javascript for loop, the variable, the conditional statement, and the counter increment, are declared within that initial parenthesis. This is all before the action that is to be looped through. If you were to translate this to logical statements the flow of the statement might not make sense. Where as, in ruby, the structure is a lot more english like. The readability of ruby is a lot easier, but some javascript processes make it an extremely useful language. </p>
